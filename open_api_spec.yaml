      Operations on Meter Devices

      ### Meter Devices

      Meter Devices are the entity that represents a physical (or logical)
      meter deployed in the field. They handle all information about how to
      communicate with the meter and how to interpret the data from the
      meter.

      Operations on Meter Device Configs

      ### Meter Device Configs

      A Meter Device Config stores the configurations of a Meter Device Type.
      As of now this stores mainly what MeteringSeries it has.
      The metering series list is used to validate if a meter reading from a
      meter device is allowed to be saved.

      The plan later on is have information about what, for example COSEM
      objects a meter has, or what MBus Vifes etc the meter has. For example can
      an IDIS complient meter share configuration with other meters of different
      make. An OMS compliant Mbus meter can also share configuration between
      different manufacturers.

      Operations on Meter Device Types

      ### Meter Device Types

      It is possible to have a meter that is of same make and model but
      differently configured. By adding a different meter type we can have a
      several different setups of the same manufacturer model.

  - name: sim-cards
    description: |
      Operations on SIM Cards

      ### SIM Cards

      Utilitarian is focused on IP communication with meters. Many meter have
      internal or external modems that are used for cellular communications.
      This require a SIM-card. Many SIM-cards in IoT data plans will give a
      fixed IP. It is possible to store all your SIM cards in Utiltarian and
      link them to your meter devices for an easy way of finding the IP for a
      meter device. If you switch a SIM cards in the field you need to switch
      it in Utilitarian so that the system can find the meter device.

      > Tips: It is possible to save a link to the managing software, for
      > example Jasper, of the SIM cards. In future Utilitarian UI this will be
      > rendered as an external link to quickly get access to logs and other SIM
      > cards operations that are not in the scope of Utilitarian.

      Operation on new meter readings

      ### New Meter Readings

      This enpoint is used by the different distributed AMR services that send
      data.
      It is not always knows by the external service what the database ID is
      for meter device or meter readings series. This endpoint will do lookups
      based on the names of the meter device and meter reading series.

      Operations on Meter Security Key Collection

      ### Meter Security Key Collection

      A Meter Security Key Collection holds all passwords, secrets and
      encryption keys for a meter device.

      The `dlms_master_key` will never be returned in any of the responses for security reasons.

      > Note: DLMS Keys are stored in hexadecimal strings. 128 bit key = 32 hex
      > characters, 256 bit key = 64 hex characters.

      Operations on Meter Readings

      ### Meter Readings

      Meter Readings are the raw data we receive from meter devices.
      They are limited to numerical data.
      Meter Readings table is designed for short term storage of meter values.

    x-displayName: Meter Readings

  - name: meter-reading-series
    description: |
      Operations on Meter Reading Series

      ### Meter Reading Series

      A MeterReadingSeries is used for grouping all meter values that should be
      viewed as a time series of values. It also adds "metadata" about the series
      so that it is possible to know more about the values contained in it.

      In Utilitarian we aim to use OBIS codes as series identifier but there is
      nothing preventing the use of any identifier for a series. Simple string
      values like "energy" and "power" could be used or more complex identifiers
      like from the CIM standard.

      Since we might have electricity meters that have current and voltage
      transformers in their measurement loops we need to specify if the series
      is affected by either the current transformer and/or the voltage
      transformer ratio.

    x-displayName: Meter Reading Series

  - name: staged-meter-readings
    description: |
      Operations on Staged Meter Readings

      ### Staged Meter Readings

      Staged Meter Readings are meter readings that when they where received by
      Utilitarian API did not have a corresponding meter. This might be due to
      that the meter was set up in the field but was not yet set up in Utilitarian
      API. To avoid loosing values we save the meter readings for a while and
      whenever a new meter device is created we will save all staged meter
      readings as normal meter readings. We also clear the staging table of old
      values after a set amount of time to make sure the list doesn't grow to
      large.

  - name: meter-system-events
    description: |
      Operations on Meter System Events

      ### Meter System Events

      A MeterSystemEvent is some form of event occurring in a MeterDevice. It
      could be an indication that something is wrong (Alarm) or an just a log
      entry that the meter switched to summer time.

    x-displayName: Meter System Events

  - name: network-interfaces
    description: |
      Operations on Network Interfaces.

      ### Network Interfaces

      A NetworkInterface is an object holding information needed for
      communication to a meter device. You can connect SIM cards to a network
      interface. Several meter devices can share the same network interface,
      for example an MBus gateway. It is also possbile for several network
      interfaces to share the same SIM Card, for example if using the same
      IP/SIM-card but different devices are under different ports. Then each
      meter device would have its own network interface specifiying the port
      but they would all share the same SIM Card to get the IP address.

      Some network interfaces only allows for one open connection and when the
      network interface is used by communication software we want to make sure
      that no other job is trying to communicate with the meter devcice. This
      is done by blocking the network interface. When the communication is done
      the network interface should be unblocked so that other jobs can connect
      to it.

      > Tips: The `host` parameter is only returned in responses and will contain
      > the following data:
      >
      >  1. FQDN. If a meter has a DNS compliant name attached to it we assume
      >     we want to use that firstly
      >  2. Static IP Address. If no FQDN is set on the meter it will return the
      >     static ip address associated with it.
      >  3. IP of SIM Card. If no static ip address or FQDN is set the meter
      >     will return the IP of the SIM Card attached to it.

  - name: amr-task-groups
    description: |
      Operations on Amr Task Groups.

      ### Amr Task Groups

      Amr Task Groups are used for managing AMR Task that should be set on Meter
      Devices together.

      One good use is to have certain "AMR Profiles" as Amr Task Groups. For example if
      you have a group of meter that should be collected hourly and another daily you
      could set up two groups: 'Hourly' and 'Daily' then set the Amr Task Group on
      specified meter devices. If you then need to make adjustments in the daily jobs
      you can do this in one place, the Amr Task Group, and not on every individual
      meter device.

    x-displayName: Amr Task Groups

  - name: amr-tasks
    description: |
      Operations on Amr Tasks.

      ### Amr Tasks

      Amr Task are object containing information on how and when to run a AMR job.
      Amr Tasks are added to meter or Amr Task Groups. If added to a meter the task
      will run for that particular meter. If you need to manage a collection of tasks
      used for several meter, use an AmrTask Group.

    x-displayName: Amr Tasks

      Direct invocation of task on demand

      ### Invoke Amr Task

      It is possible to invoke the an AMR Task on demand by using this endpoint.
      It takes a meter device id and task info and will send the task directly to the
      async workerk.

  # Common
  - name: Pagination
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      The Pagination scheme used for Utiltiarian API is a Limit/Offset scheme.

      By using a limit indicates the maximum number of items to return and the
      offset indicates the starting position of the query in relation to the
      complete set of unpaginated items. This makes for a very extensible
      pagination scheme where the client have better control of the returned
      values. In all responses the total count of items in the compleate set of
      unpaginated items are returned to be able to know where in the set a
      pagination response is located.

      The limit and offset is applied in query parameters like:

      ```
      GET https://api.example.org/accounts/?limit=100&offset=400
      ```


      The following example shows a common result set.

      ``` json
      {
        "count": 1023
        "next": "https://api.example.org/accounts/?limit=100&offset=500",
        "previous": "https://api.example.org/accounts/?limit=100&offset=300",
        "results": [
          …
        ]
      }
      ```
      > Note: Having very large result sets can lead to significant performance
      > issues.

  - name: Authentication
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |

      # Token Authentication
      Each user with `is_staff=True` is given a unique API Key Token to interact with
      the API.

      Token Authentication is made for programatical high level access of the API.
      To make other services use the API via a Token make a sepatate user for them and
      use the token in all authentications.

      Users with Token Authentication access to all actions in the API.

      For clients to authenticate, the token key should be included in the
      `Authorization` HTTP header. The key should be prefixed by the string
      literal "Token", with whitespace separating the two strings. For example:

      ```
      Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b
      ```

      Unauthenticated responses that are denied permission will result in an
      `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response with an appropriate
       WWW-Authenticate header. For example:

      ```
      WWW-Authenticate: Token
      ```


      > Note: If you are running an instance of Utilitarian API that is
      > accessable over the Internet you need to make sure that the API is
      > only served under `https`.



      # User JWT Auth
      Users with `is_staff=False` are able to request a JSON Web Token (JWT) via the
      `/auth/jwt` endpoints.

      The JWT endpoint issues a JWT with only read access to the API and will filter all
      results to the entites the users organization has access to. When using User JWT Auth
      the `organization` field of all request bodys an be omittted and if you add it in
      the request body it will be cleaned and the correct organization ID will be added.
      For users that are part of several organizations it is possible to switch
      organization by requesting a new JWT for another organization.

      User JWT Auth is used for client applications using the API. Mobile apps,
      single page application etc.

      For clients to authenticate, the JWT key should be included in the
      `Authorization` HTTP header. The key should be prefixed by the string
      literal "JWT", with whitespace separating the two strings. For example:

      ```
      Authorization: JWT eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
      ```

      Unauthenticated responses that are denied permission will result in an
      `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response with an appropriate
       WWW-Authenticate header. For example:

      ```
      WWW-Authenticate: JWT
      ```

      > Note: If you are running an instance of Utilitarian API that is
      > accessable over the Internet you need to make sure that the API is
      > only served under `https`.
