# Utilitarian API Docs

## Open API specification

We use redoc to generate documentation from Open Api Specs.

To generate the Open API docs make sure to have redoc-cli installed globally 
and use `serve.sh` to serve the documentation and get live updates from changes.
Use `bundle.sh` to bundle the documentation into a single HTML file.
