# Utilitarian Documentation

Welcome to the Utilitarian documentation. Utilitarian is a multi utility AMR 
(Automatic Meter Reading) system that gives you and your organisation 
a simple way to manager AMR operations over multiple energy medias, protocol 
and metering equipment. 

In this documentation we we cover everything about the product and our on-premise
offerings.


## Get started

To get a better grip on how Utilitarian and all its component works together check
out the [Architecture](architecture.md) page.

If you are interested in what type of communication protocols we support go to 
the [Protocols](protocols.md) page.

We are continuously adding new meters that we support, and even if we haven't 
tried out your meters yet we might already support them due to our general 
protocol interpreters, or we need to do some work to get them into the system. 
To get info on the meters we have already verified against Utilitarian go to the 
[meters](meters.md) page and if you need custom work done please 
[contact us](index.md#get-in-contact). 

As of now we are offering Utilitarian as an on-premise services. Our client base 
of utility companies usually prefer it this way. But keep a look out for the 
managed cloud version of Utilitarian. To know more about how to run Utilitarian 
check out the [installation](installation.md) page.
