# Provider specific implementations

Some metering equipment providers have well implemented integrations besides 
from pure metering protocols. This can involve HTTP Push, SMS or FTP uploads.

To make life simpler we want to be able to provide integrations with
this kind of functionality and will work to implement as many as possible.


## Ongoing Development

We are currently not developing any provider specific implementations.
If you are in need of an implementation please [contact us](index.md#get-in-contact).
